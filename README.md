# ARCADE
ARCADE is a multiplexed, high-throughput immunoassay that utilizes libraries of antigen-displaying, genetically barcoded lentiviruses to measure serum antibodies against dozens of antigens simultaneously. This repository contains the code and barcode sequences necessary to extract and analyze library member barcodes from FASTQ files. 

"ARCADE - Code for Barcode Counting and Normalization.ipynb" is a Jupyter notebook detailing how to extract library member barcode sequences from reads in FASTQ files, visualize read and barcode count metrics, and normalize library member barcode counts using barcode counts from ladder viruses and samples without serum.   

"Barcode List.xlsx" is an Excel spreadsheet with the forward and reverse barcode sequences for each library member. 

"Samples List.xlsx" is an Excel spreadsheet with the names of the samples provided in the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) separated by plate/sequencing library. FASTQ files that were analyzed for this project are available at BioProject Accession: PRJNA1364758.
